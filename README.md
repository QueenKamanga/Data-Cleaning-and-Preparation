The dataset contains missing, duplicate, and incorrectly formatted data.
This code handles missing values in the Hours_Worked column using an appropriate method (e.g., mean or median imputation). 
Remove duplicate rows if any exist.
Ensure all columns have the correct data type (e.g., Date as a datetime object). 
Verify if any employee has an abnormally high or low Tasks_Per_Hour value and flag them for further review. 
Presented findings with the help of visualizations:
Create a bar chart showing the average performance score for each department. 
Create a pie chart showing the proportion of total tasks completed by department. 
Create a line graph showing trends in the average tasks completed per hour across months.
